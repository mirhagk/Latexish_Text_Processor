Dear \Target{},

I am the \Title of \Country{}. I was awarded a sum of $\Money{}, but my government is corrupt. I must transfer the funds to a \TargetCountry bank account, please send me your account number so I can transfer it into your account. For your troubles I will leave \Math.Percentage{10}{\Money} of my money in your account.

Thank you for your troubles.
